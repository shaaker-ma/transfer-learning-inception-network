# Transfer Learning on Inception Network

This repository demonstrates the use of **Transfer Learning** with the **Inception Network** to adapt pre-trained models for new classification tasks. The project focuses on fine-tuning Inception to achieve high accuracy on small datasets while minimizing overfitting.

---

## Features
- **Pre-trained Model**: Leverages the Inception model trained on ImageNet.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Freezes feature extraction layers and trains new classification layers for task-specific adaptation.
- **Efficient Training**: Achieves high accuracy with minimal data and computational resources.
- **Visualization**: Includes results and visualizations of training performance.
